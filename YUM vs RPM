Packaging manager is the software used for managing, installing, updating, upgrading etc. of the packages of a system. 
Linux based systems or Linux systems have a lot of such packaging managers in which two are: Yum and RPM.

The fact that marks the difference between Yum and RPM is the fact that Yum can check and upgrade the packages whereas RPM cannot do so. 
Yum can also resolve dependencies on their own whereas this is not possible for RPM.



Main Difference between YUM and RPM
Yum and RPM even though are Linux system packaging managers, they are still different even in their meaning. While Yum is a top-level front end packaging manager that operates on RPM-based Linux systems, RPM is a low-level packaging manager that performs basic functions.
YUP or Yellowdog UPgrader was first made and completely developed between 1999-2000. The updated version of YUP is known as Yum and this was redeveloped or modified in 2003. Whereas RPM or Redhat was developed in 1997.
Yum can scan, sense and resolve dependencies automatically whereas RPM is unable to do so. It does not resolve the dependencies.
RPM allows you to install multiple packages, the only necessary condition being we have to give the right file name with the ‘.rpm’ extension. But in the case of Yum, it only installs the packages that are already available in their repository and shows the other packages that are already installed.
Even though one of the functions of the packaging manager is installing and upgrading packages of the Linux system, RPM does not allow upgradation of existing packages whereas Yum helps you scan the packages and notifies as well as upgrades them to their latest version.
In terms of management of these packaging managers, Yum is also the software used for managing RPM whereas RPM is difficult to handle in cases of installing and upgrading.
