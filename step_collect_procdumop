Im prolly late again, but want to chime in on notes I took some time back when I tried this on my lab and disabling self protection

Once the customer installs the debug tools, open a command prompt as admin and perform the following:
               >cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64
>gflags.exe -p /enable masvc.exe /full

You will see the following:
               path: SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options
                masvc.exe: page heap enabled
Type:
               >gflags.exe -p masvc.exe

You will see the following:
               Page heap is enabled for masvc.exe with flags (full traces )

Start up the McAfee Agent service 

Using the same CMD window, navigate to where you have procdump, and type in the following:
               > procdump.exe -ma  -e  masvc.exe
Wait for the crash. Here is the critical part: Once it crashes, you MUST verify that the event log shows the agent service termination warning. 
Once all that happens, IMMEDIATELY collect a MER

Do you know what step they get to before seeing an error?

after installing the build run below command for enable heap using gflag.exe
Disable self protection from EPO
1. C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64>gflags.exe -p
2. C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64>gflags.exe -p /enable "C:\Program
Files\McAfee\Agent\masvc.exe" /full
3. C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64>gflags.exe -p
it will show output like below.
path: SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options
masvc.exe: page heap enabled with flags (full traces )
6. procdump -ma -e -w masvc.exe
IMPORTANT: The command prompt must stay open until the exception occurs and the dump is generated.
you can download the procdump exe from below link.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump
7. then capture the procdump and MER log while crashing using procdump.exe.
8. after capture the MER and procdump you can disable heap using below command.
C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64>gflags.exe -p /disable "C:\Program Files\McAfee\Agent\masvc.exe"

If any dout or info required , please let me know.
