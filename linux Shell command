  #When we have an object file and we donâ€™t have the source code with us and we have to find out the maximum information from the file. To do so objdump plays a very vital role. The main purpose of the objdump command is to help in debugging the object file. It is used for the following listed purposes:

To retrieve archive header
To get the offset of the file
To get the bfdname
To get the demangle
To debug the file
To disassemble the file
To retrieve the file headers
  objdump -p process-name with path
  Ex- objdump -p /opt/McAfee/agent/bin/Mue



  #display all the detail of executable to library
  file executable_name
